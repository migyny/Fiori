# Fiori 
We took an offer from a company to make a flower shop website for them. Our team will make three prototypes, building the website step by step.


# First Prototype 
In our first prototype, we are aiming to make a base for the website, with main page, product page and cart, where customers can add their product and later buy it. We will also try to implement a database where product information will be stored (quantity, description, price, image etc.).

# Second prototype
In our second prototype, we will focus on user experience by adding user page, where a customer can create their account, login and save all the neccesary inforamtion on their account. We will also add a database for users, so the username, email address, login info etc. will be stored.
